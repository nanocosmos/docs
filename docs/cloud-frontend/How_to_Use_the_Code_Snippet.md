# How to Embed a nanoStream on Your Website

Embedding a live stream into your own website is really simple. Every nanoStream has its unique code snippet that is updated automatically to your setup - you only have to copy and paste it to the right place.

### Finding the nanoPlayer Code Snippet

The nanoStream H5Live Player Code Snippet can be found in the *Stream Overview* of the stream that you want to embed. You can find the *Stream Overview* from your stream list. Click on *Streams* on the left side of the homepage to find a list with all of your created streams.
