The cloud dashboard is the frontend for the bintu API for stream management.

- one ingest stream which is used by your live encoder connected to a live source (camera)

- one playout stream which can be played with nanoPlayer on all browsers


### What's new

- Create transcoded streams (depending on business agreement)
- Create secured streams 
- See playback immediately
- Intuitive way of creating and customizing a new stream
- New Stream Overview
- Steps to playout (from Ingest to Playout)
- Dashboard with compact overview

### [Dashboard](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/)

After logging in successfully you will be redirected to the [dashboard](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/).

![Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)


The overview shows your total streams, your total live streams, all users and tags of your organisation. By clicking on the boxes you will be redirected to the page that includes the full overview. 
Below your 5 latest live streams are shown. To see all, click on the "[See all streams](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/stream)" button.



### [Create Stream](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/stream/create)

Only one click ("[Create new stream](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/stream/create)") is required to create a new stream. If you want to customize the stream, there are two possibilities to do that (Add tags, Add Transcoding). They are all optional.

![Create Stream](assets/create-stream-2.png)



1. **Add Stream Tags**

  To add `stream tags` you can either type them manually in or choose from your existing ones.

![Create Stream: Add Tags](assets/create-stream-add-tags-2.png)



2. **Add Transcoding Profiles**
   If your organisation has been enabled our "transcoding" feature, your are able to set `transcoding profiles` to create a transcoded stream. You can choose from several profiles and add tags to the profile.

![Create Stream: Add Transcoding](assets/create-stream-add-transcoding-2.png)



### New stream

After creating a new stream, you see an overview with all information you need to start a stream.

![New Stream](assets/new-stream.png)



1. **Start the Ingest**
   In this section the ingest informations are placed including `RTMP streamname` and `RTMP URL`. You can copy them by clicking on the copy icon on the right end of the row.

![New Stream: Start the Ingest](assets/start-ingest.png)



2. **Access the Playout**
   In this section you can see the `live playout URL`. **By clicking on it, you can also see a code snippet which is all you need to embed the H5Live Player with your stream into your web page**. To get more informations see our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_getting_started/).

![New Stream: Access Playout](assets/access-playout.png)



If your organisation has enabled our "secure" feature you will be able to click on the `live playout URL` without having to create a new token. This is going to happen in the background. The token will be valid for an hour.
If you want to create a customized token, you can do that by clicking on the "Create Secure Token" Button next to the Header. There you can set up an `expiration date` and specific options like the `IP` or `referer` and a `single tag`. 

![New Stream: Create Secure Token](assets/new-stream-secure-token.png)



After creating it, you will see a new `playout URL` you can share. **Please copy the URL before refreshing or closing the window**. After doing that you can not access to this specific token again and will have to create a new one.

![New Stream: Secure Playout URL](assets/new-stream-playout-url.png)



3. **Stream Overview**
   This section lists all created stream. If you created a stream without transcoding, there will be only one. If not, there will be up to three. By clicking on the URL you can see the whole stream overview including several other informations.

![New Stream: Overview](assets/new-stream-stream-overview.png)



### Stream Overview

The stream overview shows all informations the stream is providing, including the stream info (`state`, `streamid`, `created at`, `stream tags`, `timecode`, `transcoding`, `push url`), the ingest informations (`RTMP streamname`, `RTMP url`) and the playout informations (H5Live (Ultra-low latency), H5Live config object, RTMP Playout, HLS Playout). You can copy properties to the clipboard by clicking on the copy button on the right.

![Stream Info](assets/stream-info-2.png)

![Stream Overview Playout](assets/stream-overview-playouts.png)



You are able to update the stream tags, after creating a stream. To do that, you need to click on the button on the top called "Update tags". 

![Stream Overview: Interactions](assets/stream-overview-interaction.png)



After clicking on "update" the tags you added will be visibile in the overview and the tags you removed will be deleted.

![Stream Overview: Update Tags](assets/update-tags.png)



By clicking on the "Delete stream" button you will be asked if you are sure about that. After confirming, you will be redirected to the stream list.

![Stream Overview: Delete Stream](assets/delete-stream.png)



If your organisation has enabled our "secure" feature, your are able to create a customized secure token aswell.
If you want to create one, you can do that by clicking on the "Create Secure Token" button. On this way you can set up an `expiration date` and specific options like the `IP` or `referer` and a `single tag` for the stream. 

![Stream Overview: Create Token](assets/new-stream-secure-token.png)



### [All Streams](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/stream)

The stream list shows all streams of your organisation. By clicking on one stream, you will be able to see the stream overview. The pagination on the bottom gives you the oportunity to browse through your streams.

![All Streams](assets/streams.png)



Streams that are live have an "Open Playout" Button at the end of the table row. By clicking on it, the playout will be opened in a new tab. Otherwise you will be redirected to the stream overview.

![All Streams](assets/streams-open-in-new.png)



You can filter them by clicking on the "Search" Button and search for stream tags, specific states, such as `created`, `live`, `ended`, `deleted` and specific start and end dates. 

![All Streams: Filter](assets/streams-filter.png)



### [Metrics](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/metrics)

By clicking on the menu item "[Metrics](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/metrics)" you will be able to choose between two buttons called "[Login](https://metrics.nanocosmos.de/#/login)" and "[Learn more](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/cloud/analytics/)". By clicking on the first button the nanoStream Analytics tool will be opened in another tab, while clicking on second button opens the nanocosmos blog.



### [Organisation](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/organisation)

This page gives you an overview about your organisation, informations depending on that and your enabled features.

![Organisation](assets/organisation-2.png)



The features are visible on the top of this page. If they are orange, your organisation enables them. If they are grey it does not and you need to contact the [sales](mailto:sales@nanocosmos.de) team, if you would like to change that.

![Organisation: Enabled Features](assets/enabled-features-2.png)



Underneath that you can see your organisation name and its hash. The Organisation hash is the part of every stream name you create. 

![Organisation: Informations](assets/organisation-info-2.png)



By clicking on the dropdown item under the title "Keys" you will be able to see your API key. Please keep it private.
"All user" gives you an overview about the user your organisation has. They can be sorted (asc/desc) by the date they are created at or by emails.

Below that you can see "All tags". You have the oportunity to create a new one or scroll through existing ones.

![Organisation: All Tags](assets/organisation-all-tags-2.png)



### [Create Secure Token](https://bintu-cloud-frontend.nanocosmos.de/secure/token)

If your organisation enables our feature "secure" you will be able to see this menu item. You can create a custom token for a specific stream or the whole organisation.
