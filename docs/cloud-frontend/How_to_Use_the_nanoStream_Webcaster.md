The nanoStream Webcaster is an online application that allows you to easily stream directly from your browser.

## Ingesting a Stream

When creating a stream using the nanoStream Cloud, you'll be asked whether you want to ingest the stream via the Webcaster or RTMP.

Ingesting a stream means sending the footage that you want to share. The ingest therefore is the first step if you want to share something live.

## Ingest Using the Webcaster

Using the Webcaster to ingest is the easiest way to start.

In the *Create Stream* interface, tick *Webcaster*. Now press *Start Stream*. You'll be redirected to your Webcaster stream setup.
