# Introduction

Welcome to the new nanoStream Cloud bintu dashboard!
This is the frontend for the bintu API.

### What you need

You don't need a lot in order to use the nanoStream Cloud properly. The nanoStream Cloud includes the nanoStream Webcaster and the nanoStream H5Live Player (nanoPlayer). The Webcaster facilitates streaming directly from the browser whereas the H5Live Player allows browser-based playback. Both of them work completely plug-in free on any browser.

To create and broadcast a live stream, you need a live source.
This can be either a webcam, external camera, streaming device, or even your PC desktop or laptop screen.
To send a live stream to nanoStream Cloud, you need a streaming software or hardware (live encoder),
or just your browser which directly can be used with nanoStream Webcaster to send a live stream to your audience.

### Getting Started
