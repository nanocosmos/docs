## Use nanoStream Cloud

It is very easy to get started. You need a live source (camera) which you can connect to the nanoStream Cloud network (CDN). It will take care about the deliver of your live stream. 
The [nanoStream H5Live Player (nanoPlayer)](../nanoplayer/nanoplayer_introduction) can be used to play your live stream on any web browser. 

To create and broadcast a live stream, you need a live source.
This can be either a webcam, external camera, streaming device, or even your PC desktop or laptop screen.
To send a live stream to nanoStream Cloud, you need a Live Encoder. It can either be a software like OBS or a hardware, or simply a web page with [nanoStream Webcaster](../webrtc/nanostream_webrtc_introduction).

## New! nanoStream Cloud 2022

With the release of nanoStream Cloud 2022, it is now even easier to create and manage live streams, especially for Adaptive Bitrate and secure streams!
