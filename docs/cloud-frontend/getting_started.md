## Use nanoStream Cloud

You don't need a lot in order to use the nanoStream Cloud properly. The nanoStream Cloud includes the [nanoStream Webcaster](../webrtc/nanostream_webrtc_introduction) and the [nanoStream H5Live Player (nanoPlayer)](../nanoplayer/nanoplayer_introduction). The Webcaster facilitates streaming directly from the browser whereas the H5Live Player allows browser-based playback. Both of them work completely plug-in free on any browser.

To create and broadcast a live stream, you need a live source.
This can be either a webcam, external camera, streaming device, or even your PC desktop or laptop screen.
To send a live stream to nanoStream Cloud, you need a streaming software or hardware (live encoder),
or just your browser which directly can be used with nanoStream Webcaster to send a live stream to your audience.
