# What is bintu?

bintu is the stream management dashboard and API for nanoStream Cloud and CDN. By using bintu, you can create and manage your live streams, to enable ultra-low-latency live streaming at a global scale.

The dashboard and API can be reached at https://bintu.nanocosmos.de . 

# What do I need?

You need a bintu account, based on our trial or a paid plan. 
You also need a live encoder, currently based on RTMP/H264/AAC.
Live playback will be supported by using our built-in H5Live Player.
By using our nanoStream Webcaster solution, you can directly start live streaming without any additional soft- or hardware, plugin-free in all browsers.
