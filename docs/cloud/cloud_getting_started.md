> Every stream is assigned a unique ID and an ingest URL for the live encoder software.

-----


### Start a live stream broadcast

To start a live stream broadcast, you need a live encoder software, either based on an `RTMP Live Encoder application`, or the browser-based [nanoStream WebRTC.live broadcaster](http://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/webrtc/nanostream_webrtc_introduction).

You can use [nanoStream Apps](http://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanostream/nanostream), or 3rd part software like [OBS (Open Broadcaster)](https://obsproject.com/) or professional Live Encoders like [Elemental Live](https://www.elemental.com/products/aws-elemental-live).

> The primary ingest protocol is RTMP.

**Copy/paste the ingest URL to use it with your live encoder software**

Example: 
```
rtmp://bintu-stream.nanocosmos.de/live/XYZ1-2345
```

For some live encoder software, you might need to separate the stream url and stream name, e.g.

- RTMP URL: `rtmp://bintu-stream.nanocosmos.de/live`
- Stream Name: `XYZ1-2345`

> Some applications like `OBS` use the name `Stream Key` instead `Stream Name`

-----


### Configuring the camera and live encoder

Codecs: 
- `H264 video`,
- `AAC audio`

Video resolution: flexible, e.g. `640×480`, `1280×720`, `1920×1080`

Video bitrate: flexible, e.g. `500 kbits/s`, `1 MBit/s`

-----


### Running the stream

After entering the `RTMP ingest URL` and `stream name` into your live encoder software, you can instantly start the broadcast to nanoStream Cloud / bintu.live.

-----


### Play your live stream

Play the stream directly in your browser or by inserting the Playout URL into a player application. By using the `Web Playout URL`, you will automatically be directed to a web player page based on our unique `nanoStream H5Live` low-latency playback technology.

> **Note:** 
>
> the player URL is different from the Ingest URL!
> This is to adjust to world regional locations of our worldwide CDN with ingest and playback servers.

The H5Live player is running on a sample page which also shows an embed code to copy to your own web page.

### Manage your live streams

Select `Streams`, then `List` to find a list of all streams that you created. 

These can be sorted by `live`, `ended`, `created`, or `external` streams.

## Additional features


### Using bintu.live stream tags

You can add any text-based tags to your stream. It can be a stream `title` or any other `information` that you would like to add to the stream (category, event name, date,…). 
It can also be a `JSON string` to use for specific programmatic purposes.

> A simple use case is grouping the streams with your custom application logic.

<br>

![BintuPlayer](https://i0.wp.com/www.nanocosmos.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/BintuPlayer-1024x585.jpg?resize=474%2C271)

Every tag added to a stream is directly displayed in the Stream Info.

*See more info about tagging and how it is used in our Bintu Encoder and Player sample apps on our* [*blog*](https://www.nanocosmos.de/blog/2016/06/new-bintu-live-grouping-and-tagging-feature-for-streams/)*.*

The Bintu Encoder and Player sample apps are part of our [*mobile nanoStream SDKs*](http://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanostream/android/nanostream-android-sdk) *for iOS and Android.*

### Metrics

By selecting `Organisation` from the top menu, you can see your Organisation ID, as well as monthly and total playtime of all streams. 

> Please ask for details about other metrics you can get.
