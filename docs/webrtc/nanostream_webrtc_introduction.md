## How to build a browser-based live streaming workflow with nanoStream Webcaster and nanoStream Cloud?

We are entering a new live streaming era where <b>browser-based, plugin-free</b> and <b>ultra-low latency on any device</b> are the key drivers for interactive customer engagement. What’s needed? nanoStream Webcaster (formerly known as WebRTC.live) in combination with nanoStream Cloud!

### Live streaming to large audiences with nanoStream Webcaster

Scalability for large audiences is probably the greatest challenge for new audio/video-based interactive use cases. Scaling your live streaming means to have the capability of handling different amounts of work or, in other words, dealing with a large number of viewers that might change on a short period of time. 

Doing this completely relying on WebRTC-based workflows is challenging. WebRTC is not designed for live streaming, but rather for peer-to-peer collaboration. For live streaming to larger audiences, you need a service (SaaS, PaaS) to connect your WebRTC client to.

That’s when nanoStream Webcaster comes on board. Once connected to nanoStream Cloud, it becomes an end-to-end live streaming solution that easily scales to large audiences around the world, and the best: with ultra-low latency!

### Using nanoStream Webcaster with nanoStream Cloud

nanoStream Webcaster will work as a powerful live encoder from the broadcaster/publisher side, ingesting directly into nanoStream Cloud. On the player side, nanoStream Cloud includes [nanoStream H5Live Player](../nanoplayer/nanoplayer_introduction), an unique playback tool that works with no plugins on all HTML5 browsers, incl. Safari on iOS.

### Integration with existing live streaming environments

WebRTC.live can be used completely end-to-end with nanoStream Cloud but also integrates well with existing live streaming environments based on RTMP and HLS.

### nanoStream Cloud as a low-latency CDN

You can use nanoStream Cloud as a low-latency CDN to distribute your live streams with low latency to audiences worldwide. We handle the transport for you across our own origin/edge server network.

### Advantages of connecting to nanoStream Cloud

nanoStream Cloud including nanoStream H5Live Player is the perfect solution to deliver and playback live streams in a scalable way. It brings together the easiness of a cloud solution with the ability of delivery and playback in ultra-low latency on any device and HTML5 browser, including Safari on iOS. Hence, together with nanoStream Webcaster for live encoding, they set an entire browser-based live streaming workflow.
