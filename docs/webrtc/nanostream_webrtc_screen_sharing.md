## Screen Sharing 

`WebRTC` supports screen sharing! You can use a screen or a window, depending on a browser used, as a live video source instead of a web camera.

Screen sharing is currently available in:

  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox



## Screen sharing with Google Chrome

Chrome on Desktop since version 72 supports screen sharing without any further installation.
For former versions, a certified browser extension was required due to Google security policy.

You find the nanoStream branded screen capture extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nanostream-screen-capture/jfjljfmoopheadghnkjbonkmgbkjhjdo)
