The `nanoStream Webcaster` supports screen sharing.

Instead of a web camera you can use a screen or a window as a live video source, depending on the browser used.

## Supported Browsers

Screen sharing is currently available for desktop browsers:

  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari


## Screen sharing with Google Chrome

Chrome on Desktop since version 72 supports screen sharing without any further installation.
For former versions, a certified browser extension was required due to Google security policy.

You find the nanoStream branded screen capture extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nanostream-screen-capture/jfjljfmoopheadghnkjbonkmgbkjhjdo)
