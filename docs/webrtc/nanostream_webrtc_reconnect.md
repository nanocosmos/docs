This feature allows configuration of the reconnection behaviour on API level.
Once the webcaster will register any connection loss, it will attempt to reconnect the current webcast.

When enabled, the feature will trigger a reconnect attempt in one of the following cases:

- Change of network:
  - On mobile devices, e.g. when switching from wifi to mobile network
  - Switching between multiple wifi endpoints

- Broadcasterâ€™s brief internet interruptions
- Unexpected issues on the network side


## Automatic Reconnection Configuration

To enable the feature, the [setConfig()](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/webrtc/nanostream_webrtc_api#rtcusersetconfigconfig) API call now provides additional options:


- <b>reconnect.minDelay:</b> minimum amount of seconds to wait before attempting a reconnect after connection loss
- <b>reconnect.maxDelay:</b> maximum amount of seconds to wait before attempting a reconnect after connection loss
- <b>reconnect.maxRetries:</b> maximum amount reconnect attempts, setting this to an integer greater than 0 will enable the reconnect feature


```javascript
// add reconnection settings to your config
var config = {
  reconnect: {
    minDelay: 2,
    maxDelay: 8,
    maxRetries: 10
  }
};

rtcuser.setConfig(config);
```
