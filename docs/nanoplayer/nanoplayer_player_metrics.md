## How to use 

Player metrics are providing additional insights for our cloud support team and our [nanoStream Cloud Analytics](../cloud/analytics) service. The player metrics can be enabled by adding the `metrics` object to the player config as shown below.

**Important** <br>
If you don't have metrics account information for your organisation yet please reach out to [sales@nanocosmos.de](mailto:sales@nanocosmos.de).

#### Example player configuration with metrics enabled

```js
var config = {
    "source": {
        ...
    },
    "playback": {
        ...
    },
    "style": {
        ...
    },
    "metrics": {
        "accountId": "YOUR-METRICS-ACCOUNT-ID", // replace with your metrics account id
        "accountKey": "YOUR-METRICS-ACCOUNT-KEY", // replace with your metrics account key
        "userId": "viewer1", // value can be changed per viewer
        "eventId": "event1", // value can be changed per event
        "statsInterval": 10, // statistics interval in seconds
        "customField1": "CustomInfo1" // value can be changed
    },
    ...
}
```
