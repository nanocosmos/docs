## Please find more about the **video access and processing** feature in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_video_access_and_processing/).

## **[4.17.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is adding a new public event to the player. The event `onActiveVideoElementChange` is emitted when the active video element for playback has been created and if the element has been changed in case of a stream switch on iOS. The event data is providing the `activeVideoElement` and the complete `videoElementList`.
Having a reference to the `activeVideoElement` simplifies use cases like drawing or rendering images to a canvas or saving snapshots from the video.
See the [api description](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#onactivevideoelementchange) of the event and our [docs feature entry](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_video_access_and_processing/) for more information.
