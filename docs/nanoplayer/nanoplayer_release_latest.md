## **[4.13.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This version provides an improvement for iOS metadata processing. The new mode is preventing occasionally delayed metadata on iOS and is enabled by default.
To go back to legacy mode it can be disabled by setting the new parameter `config.playback.metadataLowDelay` to `false`.
Also an issue with changing the metadata connection at stream switch on iOS with switch method `'client'` has been solved.
Further this patch includes a fix for a potential css related layout issue in iOS fullscreen mode.
