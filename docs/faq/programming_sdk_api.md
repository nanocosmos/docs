<details><summary><strong>Which programming languages can I use for the API?</strong></summary>

nanoStream Cloud provides dashboards and application programming interfaces (API), but also code snippets and web pages which do not require programming skills.

nanoPlayer and Webcaster are based on HTML and JS (Javascript) libraries
nanoStream Cloud's bintu management service is available as dashboard and REST API

`HTML/JS (Javascript)` works for all modern HTML5 browsers. Based on this, you can use frameworks like Typescript, React, VueJS etc.

HTML/JS is supported on all devices and platforms nowadays.

For native apps, We recommend using Web Views to embed the nanoStream JS API.

If you are working on a platform without HTML/JS support, you can use fallback URLs provided by nanoPlayer. 
Please contact us for details.
