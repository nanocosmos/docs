<details><summary><strong>Which programming languages can I use for the API?</strong></summary>

Supported programming languages are dependent on the OS.

- `HTML/JS (Javascript)` works for all modern HTML5 browsers. Based on this, you can use frameworks like Typescript, React, VueJS etc.

HTML/JS is supported on all devices and platforms nowadays.

For native apps, We recommend using Web Views to embed the nanoStream JS API.

If you are working on a platform without HTML/JS support, you can use fallback URLs provided by nanoPlayer. 
Please contact us for details.
