## RTMP Playback

### Description and Features
`RTMP` Playback Component enables application developers to add playback of RTMP live and on demand streams to their apps.

Supported codecs are `H.264` Video, `AAC` and `MP3` Audio.

Video streams are decoded and rendered on a Surface that is hold by the application, usually connected to a `SurfaceView`.

Audio streams are decoded and rendered to system audio using the Android AudioSession/AudioTrack API.

The interface and usage are similar to the Android MediaPlayer. The Android MediaPlayerControl interface is implemented to enable control through an `android.widget.MediaController` instance.



### License

The playback component requires a special feature flag to be enabled in your nanoStream license key. It not necessarily included in nanoStream Android SDK licenses.



### Interface

#### Package name
`net.nanocosmos.nanoStream.streamer`



#### Declaration

`public abstract class NanostreamPlayer implements MediaPlayercontrol, Surfaceholder.Callback`
#### Function Life Cycle

### Creating an Instance
`NanostreamPlayer` instances can be created through the static factory function `createNanostreamPlayer` at the top level `nanoStream class`. NanostreamPlayer is designed to support multiple player instances. The number of parallel instances can be limited by system resources such as codec,surfaces,memory, network connections and bandwidth.
### Configuration and Settings
Initial player settings are wrapped by the `NanostreamPlayer.PlayerSettings` class. The settings can be applied by calling `NanostreamPlayer.setSettings`.

### PlayerSettings:

### Audio / Video Format

After the `NanostreamEvent.CODE_STREAM_AUDIO/VIDEO_FORMAT_AVAILABLE` event, you can get the MediaFormat Object with the `getAudio/VideoFormat()`[^(2)] function call.
We added two custom Fields for the Video MediaFormat:
&nbsp; &nbsp; `NanostreamPlayer.KEY_ASPECT_RATIO_WIDTH`
&nbsp; &nbsp; `NanostreamPlayer.KEY_ASPECT_RATIO_HEIGHT`
With these custom fields you can get the aspect ratio width and height.

```java
MediaFormat videoFormat = mPlayer.getVideoFormat();

int aspectRatioWidth = videoFormat.getInteger(NanostreamPlayer.KEY_ASPECT_RATIO_WIDTH);
int aspectRatioHeight = videoFormat.getInteger(NanostreamPlayer.KEY_ASPECT_RATIO_HEIGHT);
```



### Implementation Example

```java
public class PlayerActivity extends Activity implements PlayerEventListener, SurfaceHolder.Callback {
    ...
    private NanostreamPlayer mPlayer = null;
    private String license = "YOUR LICENSE CODE";

    private String strStreamUrl = "rtmp://192.168.1.100/vod";
    private String strStreamname = "mp4:file.mp4";

    private LinearLayout root;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        root = new LinearLayout(this);
        root.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);
        root.setLayoutParams(containerParams);
        root.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLACK);

        ...

        mPlayer = nanoStream.createNanostreamPlayer();

        PlayerSettings settings = mPlayer.new PlayerSettings();

        settings.setLicense(license);
        settings.setUrl(strStreamUrl);
        settings.setStreamname(strStreamname);
        settings.setAuthUsername("");
        settings.setAuthPassword("");
        settings.setBufferTimeMs(2000);

        mPlayer.setSettings(settings);
        mPlayer.setPlayerEventListener(this);

        ...
        // we need a surface Callback for the application
        LinearLayout.LayoutParams surfaceParams = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT, 0.5F);
