# DirectShow Filter usage with GraphEdit / GraphStudioNext
All Live Video Encoder components are available as `DirectShow` filters and may be used within DirectShow applications.

We recommend using [GraphStudio](https://code.google.com/p/graph-studio-next/ ) as a replacement for GraphEdit, as `RTMP` URLs may be set easily with this software.

## Setting DirectShow properties from C++
The `H.264` parameters may be set by calling the `InanoCodecOpts` interface. The `RTMP` output path may be set by calling the `SetFileName()` method of the default DirectShow `FileSinkFilter` interface.
